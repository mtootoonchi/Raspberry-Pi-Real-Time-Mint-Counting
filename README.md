# Raspberry-Pi-Real-Time-Mint-Counting

This is a Real-Time Mint Counting program tested using the Raspberry Pi 3 B+ using Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit), it may work on other devices however. This program uses a Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2 connected to the Raspberry Pi with a CSI camera port to take video for detecting how much mints there are but also to stream that video on a local network to an internet browser along with other information all Real-Time streamed.
